Today's subway car is romantic in its microcosm. Orthogonal to me there's an older man in all-black Adidas - grey hair, grey eyes, eyebrows hidden by the sweat-soaked bill of a baseball cap. He unfolds a stapled packet of small black print, conservatively-justified, the paragraphs broken up by elegant formulae.  I figure he’s got to be some kind of economics or stats wonk - what other kind of human so cheerfully scans through Laffer curves at 8 in the morning? Two seats up, I see one of the Black Hats - a timeless, classic Charedi gentleman.  He sports an impenetrable gaze, enmeshed in relentless spiritual discipline - aged far beyond his years.

                <p>
Two young professionals join the car - a man in the lanky, corporate mold engaged in banal conversation with a woman slightly taller than him.  He’s not so distinguished in his dress, but healthily overcompensates with a far-over-capacity briefcase.  She has mahogany-brown hair, form-fitting khakis that only go down to the ankle, and a casual half-smile - effortless at courting interest, though not so interested herself.  That game goes on for a bit, until they get off at 47th. 
                </p>
                <p>
I don't remember when the stats wonk or the Charedi gentleman took their leave, but at some point the subway car loses its archetypal glow - fading into a morass of grey faceless people, hooded, bland, consumed by mobile-phone screens; unripe for the imagination.
