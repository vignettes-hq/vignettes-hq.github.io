Milton, having placed his arms at the podium, let forth a stream of classical rhetoric in the manner of a mild but confident Chicago statesman.  He frequently punctuated his arguments with a notable rise in pitch: “…so you see, there is absolutely NO doubt what-so-EVER…” and so on.  His facial expressions moved fluidly from mild amusement to consternation and back again.

Unknown to the hundred or so scruffy, left-minded university kids in the audience — Milton stood at a mere five feet tall.  Reagan, nor Thatcher, had seemed to mind at all — by the late 1980s, the landscape of American political economy had been forever changed by Milton’s creed — freedom over equality; the individual over his community; global trade over the protection of domestic industry.

Paul Cromwell, a economics major seated in the front row, scratched the inside of his ear with a worn-out Ticonderoga pencil.  Hailing from Queens, NY — son of a city government employee and a high-school teacher — Paul had been raised to doubt both the morals and the mathematics behind the so-called Chicago school.  In his other ear — the one unoccupied by pencil lead — he recalled the nasal tenor of his father’s voice: “…the academics don’t give a damn about the working man … we’re just numbers to them…”

And yet, somehow, something in Milton’s words struck Paul as unsettlingly profound and compelling.  This man was not peddling word-salad nor out-of-context statistical models, but careful and considered reasoning, filtered by mere logical scrutiny and the basic premises of Enlightened government.  This was nothing more than Locke, or Mill, translated into the common parlance of 20th century politics.  Paul squirmed in his seat, and thought to leave — but he couldn’t manage to tear his attention away from the sing-song proclamations of the little man at the podium.

“…and when the state, in pursuit of good intentions, tries to rearrange the economy, legislate morality, or help special interests, the cost comes, ultimately, in the loss of freedom…”
