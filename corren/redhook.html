                    Mill and Dwight St meet at the entrance of a small community park, where they merge into a skinny concrete path and cut the place into two halves - adjacent panels of dark grass, glistening in the fluorescence of street-side lamplight.

                    A Puerto Rican kid weaves tiny circles into the sidewalk on a small bicycle. He repeats, at 10- to 15-second intervals, the easy thrill of lifting his front wheels just high enough above the ground to tempt gravity before averting a wipeout. He's no more than twelve or thirteen. Huddling against the hard fencing of a basketball court, two teenage girls laugh beside an older boy who stands stiff, Spartan-like - making no sound.

                    The park's west edge faces Richard St, home to $10 ATMs, grocery stores with names hard to make out, places with shuttered windows, beautiful crumbling apartments that wrap around the street corner, tiny restaurants with Spanish signs, now closed, bars filled with regulars and from which indiscernible music escapes into a night otherwise cold and silent, other things invisible in the dark.
