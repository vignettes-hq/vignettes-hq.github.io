                    Nothing spells boredom quite like a Tuesday afternoon in suburban Ohio. Amid the vast swath of fields, parking lots, and chain restaurants sits Scramblers, a mediocre diner my colleagues have coerced me into entering.

                    As we wait to be seated, an elderly, retired couple wanders in - neither is speaking to the other. Their monotone faces are a window into their weary souls, devoid of hope or excitement. It strikes me that while Scramblers is a mere pitstop for me, for them, it might as well be the highlight of their week.

                    As my colleagues and I settle into a sterile, tan-colored booth, a heavy-set waitress approaches our table&mdash;her name-card reads &lsquo;Darlene.&rsquo; I can tell within moments that she&rsquo;s the kind of woman who says things like "Oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t," before a pre-meditated reach for another slice of cake. She asks us for our order, but it&#39;s clear that she’s far more concerned with determining what she&#39;ll eat for lunch, rather than hearing what I&#39;d like to eat. I inform her I&#39;m not ready&mdash; I&#39;m still trying to locate something digestible on the menu.

                    Scramblers is an all-day breakfast place, serving up wholesome American fare of the likes of cream cheese stuffed french toast and towering stacks of Oreo pancakes. I aim to live past 50, so I choose the one item on the menu containing a vegetable&mdash;the &ldquo;garden salad.&rdquo; It probably has bacon bits, but life is about compromises. This fact becomes ever more clear as my colleagues complain about the age-old pains of corporate life, while scarfing down meals financed by their hefty JP Morgan provided salaries.

                    Since I can remember, America has been at war, and in this moment I have never felt so grateful to our troops, the one&rsquo;s defending our freedom&mdash;the freedom that grants me the ability to enjoy an hour of my day at Scramblers, on a beautiful, sunny, Ohio afternoon.
