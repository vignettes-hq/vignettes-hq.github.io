                    It was hard to imagine beforehand that the Columbus, OH pride parade would attract nearly half a million attendees, but for whatever reason, it did. Swarms of young, bearded hipsters collided smoothly with scruffy rednecks, cheering on the sidelines. There were, of course, the nay-sayers&mdash; devout Christians stood in front of the statehouse, arguing not for the law enshrined by our legislature, but the one enumerated in the Bible. Silently, they flouted signs carrying the slogans "Biblical Man + Biblical Woman = Real Family" and "Feminism is Rebellion" (it was ambiguous as to whether such a rebellion might be good or bad - but I was willing to bet it wasn't a positive).

                    About an hour in, a small group of Black Lives Matter protesters marched solemnly and resolutely into the fray, forming a line to prevent the rest of the parade from unfolding. Naturally, the police show up - they tackle protesters, the crowd alternatively boos and then cheers, the Christians throw their signs up into the air and a half-naked man dances in no shy way to "YMCA" atop a bedazzled double-decker bus.

                    Throughout history people have asked a simple question: why can't we all just get along? Maybe we could, but it sure as hell wouldn't be this interesting.
