                    It was hard to imagine beforehand that the Columbus gay pride parade attracted nearly half a million attendees, but for whatever reason, it did. Swarms of young bearded hipsters collided smoothly with overweight, scruffily bearded rednecks as they all sat on the sidelines cheering as the events got underway. There were of course the nay sayers&mdash;the devout Christians standing in front of the statehouse, arguing that we must ignore the rule of law, and focus instead on the law of the Bible. Silently, they flouted signs that read such things as "biblical man + biblical woman = real family" and "feminism is rebellion" (which seemed ambiguous as to whether this was good or bad, but I was willing to bet it wasn't a positive).

                    About an hour in a small group of black lives matter protesters walk calmly and without word onto the street, forming a line, and blocking the rest of the parade from unfolding. As the police tackle the protesters, the crowd boos and cheers, the Christians throw their signs up into the air and a half-naked man dances flamboyantly to the YMCA atop a bedazzled, double decker bus.

                    Throughout history people have asked a simple question: why can't we all just get along? Maybe we could, but it sure wouldn't be this interesting.
