                    The only thing more exciting than a minor league baseball game is a major league baseball game and just about anything else. Yet I find myself at Huntington Park watching the Columbus Clippers take on the Durham Bulls, surrounded by my fellow interns, socializing with people that will never be my friends.

                    The events taking place on the field pale in comparison to the game going on in the bleachers where a group of strangers, myself included, attempt to make small talk with one another. The girl seated in front of me is especially keen on making sure she’s not ignored, grasping nervously on to a gallon sized cup of beer it appears medication isn't always found in a translucent orange tube.

                    She turns and stares at us as we talk, just waiting for a break in conversation where she can make her move. Within moments she's found what she's looking for, and against our will, informs us that she's from New York City—a coastal elite whose elevated status appears to mean nothing in the context of this midwestern setting. Soon it's off to the races and she's talking about her boyfriend and his gluten allergy that has rendered any form of Italian cuisine an impossibility for date nights. I want to care, but it's hard. On the one hand, I empathize with her desire to be part of the group, but on the other, I'm not quite sure why I should be interested in her boyfriends gluten free lifestyle. And quite frankly, watching her struggle is an entertaining social experiment.

                    As the conversation continues, she’ll frequently turn to me and our eyes will lock. Why is she doing this? Soon she’s talking about her student job at Ohio State, where she helps the dining halls manage their inventory. What a strange thing to think anyone would find compelling. But she keeps talking and soon I’m doing to her what she had done to me—frequently turning to her, our eyes locking. Why am I doing this?

                    As the night reaches it’s anti-climatic finale, the sky darkens and we all take our leave. I exit the stadium and see her standing alone on the brick covered street corner. Silently, I wave goodbye. I don’t even know her name.
