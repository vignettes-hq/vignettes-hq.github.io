                    Nothing spells boredom quite like a Tuesday afternoon in suburban Ohio. Amid the vast swath of fields, parking lots, and chain restaurants sits Scramblers, a restaurant my colleagues have coerced me into entering.

                    As we wait to be seated an elderly, retired couple wanders in, either speaking to the other. Their monotone faces are a window into their weary souls, devoid of hope or excitement. For me Scramblers is a pitstop, for them, it will be the highlight of their week.

                    As my colleagues and I settle into or sterile, tan colored booth, a heavy-set waitress approaches our table&mdash;her name-card reads &lsquo;Darlene.&rsquo; I can tell within moments that she&rsquo;s the kind of women who likely said last night "oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t," followed by a pre-meditated reach for another slice of cake. She asks us for our order, but it&#39;s clear that she’s far more concerned with determining what she&#39;ll eat for lunch, rather than hearing what I&#39;d like to eat. I inform her I&#39;m not ready&mdash;at the moment I&#39;m still in the process of locating something digestible on the menu.

                    Scramblers is an all-day breakfast place, serving up wholesome American fare of the likes of cream cheese stuffed french toast and towering stacks of Oreo pancakes. I aim to live past 50, so I choose the one item on the menu containing a vegetable&mdash;the &ldquo;garden salad.&rdquo; It probably has bacon bits, but life is about compromises. This fact becomes ever more clear as my colleagues complain about the age old, almost biblical, pains of corporate life, while scarfing down meals financed by their hefty, JP Morgan provided, six figure salaries.

                    Since I can remember, America has been at war, and in this moment I have never felt so grateful to our troops, the one&rsquo;s defending our freedom&mdash;the freedom that grants me the ability to enjoy an hour of my day at Scramblers, on a beautiful, sunny, Ohio afternoon.
